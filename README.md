# Security Analysis Tool
### Home Assignment for Junior Software Engineer (Security Team)
####Thoughts
- I looked at RepoGuard source code and had no idea how I could integrate that.
- A few things that I have tried:
GitHub API - github3.py, PyGithub
  Using Github api should be the best approach to get the content from the input repo link.
scrapping contents from the repo link directly (bad approach)
- If I had more time, I'd like to explore and play around with RepoGuard and Let's be Bad Guys tutorial before doing this assignment.
